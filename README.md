# About This Repository

This repository contains study files and exercises developed during the Data Science program at Uninter University. The files are written in **Portuguese** and include practical implementations of concepts taught in class.

## What's Inside

You'll find:
- Files dedicated to specific applications, named based on their purpose (e.g., `calcula_imc.py`, `tabuada_for.py`).
- Larger files containing multiple exercises and code experiments, reflecting in-class discussions and problem-solving approaches (e.g., `teste_(function/command name)`).

## Topics Covered
- **Hello World!**: Introductory programming exercises.
- **Output Functions**: Using `print` to display results.
- **Operators and Mathematical Operations**: Working with arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Exploring numeric, logical, and string types.
- **Strings**: Concatenation, slicing, and length calculation (`len()` function).
- **Input Functions**: Capturing user input with `input()`.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implementing simple and compound conditionals.

These files aim to demonstrate foundational programming concepts, with some exercises showcasing real-world applications. Both the focused and mixed-content files are valuable for understanding the thought process behind the code.

Feel free to explore and experiment!
